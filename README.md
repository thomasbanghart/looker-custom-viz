### Work in Progress 

This package will eventually be used for rapid visualization development for Looker's custom visualization API.
Includes ready-made `package.json`, `webpack.config`, `tsconfig` and `.eslint` configurations in addition to a bare-bones visualization skeleton using a React functional component.

## Usage
Ensure you have `node` > 5.2 and then simply run `npx looker-custom-viz <path-to-directory>` to install the default template. 

More templates coming soon!
