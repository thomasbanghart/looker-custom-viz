!WIP!

This package will eventually be used for rapid visualization development for Looker's custom visualization API.
Includes ready-made `package.json`, `webpack.config`, `tsconfig` and `.eslint` configurations in addition to a bare-bones visualization skeleton using a React functional component.

More templates coming soon!
